## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Camera Won't Start
- ✔️ Check browser camera permissions (allow camera in browser settings)
- ✔️ Make sure no other app is using the camera
- ✔️ Refresh page and try again
- ✔️ Use Chrome/Edge (best browser support)

### Analysis Says "No Civic Issue"
- The AI didn't recognize the object as civic infrastructure
- Try different angle/lighting
- Ensure object fills majority of frame
- Clear, well-lit photos work best

### AI-Generated Image Detected
- System blocked your image as possibly AI-generated or fake
- Use real, genuine photographs
- System has anti-spoofing measures enabled

### Issue Won't Submit
- ✔️ Check internet connection
- ✔️ Verify admin token hasn't expired (log in again)
- ✔️ Check browser console for specific error message
- ✔️ Ensure backend is running on Render

---

## 📱 Browser Support
- ✅ **Chrome/Chromium** (Best support)
- ✅ **Edge** (Full support)
- ✅ **Firefox** (Good support)
- ✅ **Safari** (Camera may need permissions setup)
- ❌ **Internet Explorer** (Not supported)

---

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Good Lighting**: Bright, natural light gives better AI results
2. **Clear View**: Make sure civic issue is clearly visible in frame
3. **Steady Hand**: Keep camera steady while capturing
4. **Fill Frame**: Let issue occupy significant portion of frame
5. **Real Photos**: Use genuine photographs, not screenshots
6. **Test Multiple**: Try different angles to find best detection

## 🎯 What Happens After Auto-Submit

1. **Immediate**: Issue appears in Admin Dashboard
2. **Real-time**: Other admins see the new issue instantly (via socket.io)
3. **Stored**: Issue saved to MongoDB with `isLiveDetection: true` flag
4. **Trackable**: Issue gets unique ID and full citizen dashboard visibility
5. **Actionable**: Can be assigned, tracked, and resolved like normal issues
